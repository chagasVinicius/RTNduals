abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in most aspects of cellular differentiation and homeostasis, and consequently have roles in many pathologies, including cancer. These small non-coding RNAs exert their effects in the context of complex regulatory networks, often made all the more extensive by the inclusion of transcription factors as their direct targets. In recent years, the increased availability of gene expression data and the development of methodologies that profile miRNA targets en masse have fuelled our understanding of miRNA functions, and of the sources and consequences of miRNA dysregulation. Advances in experimental and computational approaches are revealing not just cancer pathways controlled by single miRNAs but also intermeshed regulatory networks controlled by multiple miRNAs, which often engage in reciprocal feedback interactions with the targets that they regulate.},

abstract ={Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can jointly regulate target gene expression in the forms of feed-forward loops (FFLs) or feedback loops (FBLs). These regulatory loops serve as important motifs in gene regulatory networks and play critical roles in multiple biological processes and different diseases. Major progress has been made in bioinformatics and experimental study for the TF and miRNA co-regulation in recent years. To further speed up its identification and functional study, it is indispensable to make a comprehensive review. In this article, we summarize the types of FFLs and FBLs and their identified methods. Then, we review the behaviors and functions for the experimentally identified loops according to biological processes and diseases. Future improvements and challenges are also discussed, which includes more powerful bioinformatics approaches and high-throughput technologies in TF and miRNA target prediction, and the integration of networks of multiple levels.},
